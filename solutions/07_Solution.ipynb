    "Here are some interesting correlations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have a correlation of 1 between protons and electrons,\n",
    "  as expected (atoms have the same number of protons and electrons).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The correlation between the number of protons (or neutrons) and neutrons is almost 1:\n",
    "  Atoms with more protons will generally have more neutrons, but the numbers are not necessarily the same\n",
    "  (as in isotopes). But if you plot the number of neutrons as a function of the\n",
    "  number of protons, you will get a nice straight line (as suggested by the high\n",
    "  correlation coefficient).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Further, we have that the mass is also highly positively correlated with the number of\n",
    "  protons (or electrons or neutrons), as expected since the number of particles determines the mass.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The number of particles (protons, electrons, or neutrons) is not strongly correlated with\n",
    "  radius, electronegativity, or the first ionization energy. There is some correlation here\n",
    "  , but the number of protons does not solely determine properties like the radius. We know\n",
    "  that the radius mainly increases with the number of protons (when we go down the rows in the\n",
    "  periodic table), but it decreases with the number of protons when we move across one row\n",
    "  (e.g., compare F and B).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The electronegativity and the first ionization energy are positively correlated.\n",
    "  The ionization energy is the energy needed to remove an electron from a neutral\n",
    "  atom. Electronegativity quantifies how \"well\" an atom attract shared electrons in a\n",
    "  chemical bond. These two quantities reflect the same underlying properties (the electron\n",
    "  configuration and the forces between the nucleus and the electrons), so we expect\n",
    "  them to be positively correlated.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The atomic radius is negatively correlated with both the electronegativity and the first ionization\n",
    "  energy. If we simplify things, the ionization energy is determined by the coulomb force between the\n",
    "  nucleus and the outermost electron. Since this drops with increasing radius, we expect a\n",
    "  negative correlation with the atomic radius. We can use the same reasoning for the\n",
    "  electronegativity; the \"pulling\" force on extra electrons will increase with a smaller\n",
    "  radius (distance), so we also expect a negative correlation here."
