    "# Exercise set 7: Signal processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this exercise is to gain practical experience with signal processing techniques used for preprocessing, for instance, of Near-Infrared (NIR) spectra. Preprocessing methods are important for improving the signal-to-noise ratio, correcting for scattering effects (variations in light path due to particle size, etc.), and enhancing spectral features, which can lead to more reliable analysis and development of robust predictive models. In addition, you will see how we can smooth noisy signals and calculate the derivative of a noisy signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this exercise set, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocess spectra by normalisation, multiplicative scatter correction, or taking a second derivative.\n",
    "- Create a spline to smooth a signal and compute its derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To get the exercise approved, complete the following problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- [7.1(a)](#7.1(a)) and at least one of [7.1(b)](#7.1(b)), [7.1(c)](#7.1(c)), or [7.1(d)](#7.1(d)): To show that you can apply preprocessing to NIR spectra.\n",
    "- [7.2(a)](#7.2(a)) and [7.2(c)](#7.2(c)): To show that you can create a B-spline to smooth a signal and compute its derivative."

    "\n",
    "We will analyze NIR spectra from two distinct Ethiopian [sorghum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum) cultivars to determine if they can be differentiated. Specifically, we will examine how different preprocessing techniques impact the outcome of a principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the spectra. \n",

    "](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0193620) who used a miniaturised NIR spectrometer to identify Ethiopian crop cultivars. To simplify the analysis, we focus on measurements from only two of the ten sorghum cultivars studied in the original work\n",

    "**Hint:** You can create the B-spline basis set using the `bbase` function from Eilers and Marx (see the code cell below). You can use this function to create the smoothed signal by completing the following steps:\n",

    "1. First calculate the B-spline design matrix `X`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ndx = 20  # Number of B-spline segments\n",
    "degree = 3  # B-spline degree\n",
    "X = bbase(t_noisy, ndx=ndx, deg=degree)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create the penalty matrix `Dn` (typically, we use D2 or D3 for better interpolation):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n = X.shape[1]\n",
    "order = 2  # Order of the penalty (1, 2, or 3)\n",
    "Dn = np.diff(np.eye(n), n=order, axis=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create the augmented matrix `Xaug` that combines the design matrix `X` obtained from `bbase` with the scaled penalty matrix `sqrt(gamma)*D`, and the augmented column vector `yaug` that combines the y-values from the data set with a vector of zeros equal in length to the number of rows of D:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create the augmented matrix Xaug\n",

    "Xaug = np.vstack([X, np.sqrt(gamma) * Dn])\n",
    "# Create the augmented column vector yaug\n",
    "yaug = np.concatenate([y_noisy, np.zeros(Dn.shape[0])])\n",

    "beta_hat = np.linalg.lstsq(Xaug, yaug, rcond=None)[0]\n",
