    "## The PLS method\n",
    "\n",
    "In PLS, we are looking for scores $\\mathbf{t}$ (for X) and $\\mathbf{u}$ (for y) so that the covariance\n",
    "is maximised. The main idea is that the scores should explain the variance in X and Y and the\n",
    "covariance between X and Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance can be calculated by $\\mathbf{t}^\\top \\mathbf{u}$ (the dot product between\n",
    "the scores). We shall see later how we can find the directions in X and Y to maximise the covariance, but let us assume that we have found them. In PLS, these directions\n",
    "are referred to as the *weights* $\\mathbf{w}_x$ (for X) and $\\mathbf{w}_y$ (for Y).\n",
    "We can use these *weights* to calculate the scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathbf{t} &= \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}_x, \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{u} &= \\mathbf{Y} \\mathbf{w}_y .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we will predict $\\mathbf{Y}$ from some measured $\\mathbf{X}$. Then, the relations\n",
    "above do not seem too helpful since they do not directly relate $\\mathbf{Y}$ and $\\mathbf{X}$. So we need\n",
    "to connect the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would have a perfect correlation between the scores so\n",
    "that $\\mathbf{u} = g \\mathbf{t}$ where $g$ is some number.\n",
    "But in general, this is not the case. Instead, we will approximate $\\mathbf{u}$ from $\\mathbf{t}$ using\n",
    "this relation. The least squares approximation for $g$ is,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "g = \\frac{\\mathbf{t}^\\top \\mathbf{u}}{\\mathbf{t}^\\top \\mathbf{t}},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "- When we train the model, we supply both $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$.\n",
