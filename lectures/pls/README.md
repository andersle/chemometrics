# Examples for partial least squares (PLS)

* Example 1: Using PLS for regression. In this example we will use PLS for regression and
  compare it with least squares and LASSO.

* Example 2: Theory. In this example we will dig deeper into the theory and calculate the first
  PLS components manually. For this example, there are two notebooks:
  - A notebook where we only have one variable for y (PLS1): [Open the example (plstheory1D.ipynb) in binder.](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andersle/chemometrics/main?urlpath=/tree/lectures%2Fpls%2Fplstheory1D.ipynb)
  - A notebook where we have more than one variable for y (PLS2): [Open the example (plstheory.ipynb) in binder.](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andersle/chemometrics/main?urlpath=/tree/lectures%2Fpls%2Fplstheory.ipynb)

* Example 3: Interpretation of PLS. This example is based on data from the paper
  [Monarch butterfly population decline in North America: identifying the threatening processes. *Royal Society Open Science*, 4, 170760](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.170760) and we will use PLS to investigate variables that might influence the decline in the Monarch butterfly population.
  In this example, we will investigate how to interpret the *loadings* from PLS.
