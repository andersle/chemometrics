# Exercise notebooks and solutions

This folder contains Jupyter notebook exercises and their corresponding solutions for TKJ4175/KJ8175.
The solutions will be posted after the exercise deadline.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can either:

* **Run the notebooks in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/):** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andersle/chemometrics/main?filepath=%2Fexercises)
   This will launch an interactive environment where you can run the notebooks without any local setup.

* **Run the notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**: Follow these steps:
    * Navigate to the notebook you want to open.
    * Copy the URL and modify it by replacing `github.com` with `githubtocolab.com` (that is add `tocolab`).
    * When the notebook has opened in Colab, copy the needed files:

* **Clone the repository:** If you prefer to work locally, you can clone the repository to your computer:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:andersle/chemometrics.git
    ```

## Exercises

The exercises are organized into numbered folders (e.g., `exercise-000`, `exercise-001`, etc.).
Each folder typically contains:

* **Exercise notebook:** A Jupyter notebook with instructions, code cells for you to complete, and questions to answer.
* **Solution notebook:** A corresponding Jupyter notebook with the solutions to the exercises.
* **Data files, figures and illustrations (if applicable):** Any data files required for the exercises and figures/illutrations used in the notebooks.

* exercise-000: This contains two Jupyter notebooks which you can use to familiarize yourself with Jupyter and to brush up on Python skills.
