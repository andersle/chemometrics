This, however, does not provide a realistic evaluation of how well the model generalizes to *new, unseen data*. A model could perfectly \"memorize\" the training data, achieving excellent performance on it, but fail miserably on new samples. This phenomenon, known as **overfitting**, occurs when the model becomes too specific to the training data and loses its ability to generalize.\n",

    "The file [solubility_test.csv](solubility_test.csv) contains data for additional molecules *not* used in training. This data, called the **test set** or **test data** can be used to **test** how well our model is predicting solubilities for new samples.\n",

    "2. Use your trained model to predict the solubilities for the molecules in `X_test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate RÂ² and the MAE using the *test set* predictions and the true values from `solubility_test.csv`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Compare the test set performance metrics (RÂ², MAE, and the scatter plot) with the training set performance metrics you calculated previously. Note any differences you observe and explain what these differences might suggest about your model's ability to generalize to new data."
