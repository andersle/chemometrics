This, however, does not provide a realistic evaluation of how well the model generalizes to *new, unseen data*. A model could perfectly \"memorize\" the training data, achieving excellent performance on it, but fail miserably on new samples. This phenomenon, known as **overfitting**, occurs when the model becomes too specific to the training data and loses its ability to generalize.\n",

    "To assess how well our model is predicting *new* samples and check for overfitting, we must apply it to a set of data that was not part of the training data.\n",
    "The file [solubility_test.csv](solubility_test.csv) contains data for additional molecules *not* used in training. This data, called the **test set** or **test data** can be used to **test** how well our model is predicting solubilities for new samples.\n",

    "1. Load the data from `solubility_test.csv` into a new design matrix, `X_test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use your trained model to predict the solubilities for the molecules in `X_test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate R² and the MAE using the *test set* predictions and the true values from `solubility_test.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a scatter plot of predicted vs. actual solubilities for the *test set*.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compare the test set performance metrics (R², MAE, and the scatter plot) with the training set performance metrics you calculated previously. Note any differences you observe and explain what these differences might suggest about your model's ability to generalize to new data."
