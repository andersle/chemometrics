    "In this case, what genes you get will vary due to the randomness in the algorithm making the decision tree classifier. But it will typically pick out some of the genes we found in the previous exercise. Here, we could try many trees and see what genes are picked out most frequently. This is a bit tedious to do by hand, but luckily, there is an approach that will essentially do this. This is called a random forest classifier. For completeness, let use this one and plot the importance of the different genes for making the classification:"
