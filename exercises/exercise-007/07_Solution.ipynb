    "# Solution to exercise set 7\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this exercise is to gain practical experience with signal processing techniques used for preprocessing, for instance, of Near-Infrared (NIR) spectra. Preprocessing methods are important for improving the signal-to-noise ratio, correcting for scattering effects (variations in light path due to particle size, etc.), and enhancing spectral features, which can lead to more reliable analysis and development of robust predictive models. In addition, you will see how we can smooth noisy signals and calculate the derivative of a noisy signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this exercise set, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocess spectra by normalisation, multiplicative scatter correction, or taking a second derivative.\n",
    "- Create a spline to smooth a signal and compute its derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To get the exercise approved, complete the following problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- [7.1(a)](#7.1(a)) and at least one of [7.1(b)](#7.1(b)), [7.1(c)](#7.1(c)), or [7.1(d)](#7.1(d)): To show that you can apply preprocessing to NIR spectra.\n",
    "- [7.2(a)](#7.2(a)) and [7.2(c)](#7.2(c)): To show that you can create a B-spline to smooth a signal and compute its derivative."

    "## Exercise 7.1 Preprocessing NIR spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze NIR spectra from two distinct Ethiopian [sorghum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum) cultivars to determine if they can be differentiated. Specifically, we will examine how different preprocessing techniques impact the outcome of a principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the spectra. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The dataset used in this exercise is derived from [Kosmowski and Worku\n",
    "](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0193620) who used a miniaturised NIR spectrometer to identify Ethiopian crop cultivars. To simplify the analysis, we focus on measurements from only two of the ten sorghum cultivars studied in the original work\n",
