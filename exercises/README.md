# Exercise notebooks and solutions

This folder contains Jupyter notebook exercises and their corresponding solutions for TKJ4175/KJ8175.
The exercises are organized into numbered folders (e.g., `exercise-000`, `exercise-001`, etc.).
Each folder typically contains:
* Exercise notebook: A Jupyter notebook with instructions, code cells for you to complete, and questions to answer.
* Solution notebook: A corresponding Jupyter notebook with the solutions to the exercises (made available
after the exercise deadline).
* Data files, figures and illustrations (if applicable): Any data files required for the exercises and figures/illutrations used in the notebooks.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can either:

* **Run the notebooks in Binder:** Press [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andersle/chemometrics/main?filepath=%2Fexercises) to launch an interactive environment where you can run the notebooks without any local setup.


* **Run the notebooks in Google Colab:** Follow these steps:
    1. Navigate to the exercise notebook you want to open on GitHub.
    2. Copy the URL and modify it by replacing `github.com` with `githubtocolab.com`.
    3. Open the modified URL in your browser. This will open the notebook in Google Colab.
    4. **Important:** To access data files, you may need to download them individually from the GitHub repository and upload them to your Colab environment.


* **Clone the repository:** If you prefer to work locally, you can clone the repository to your computer:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:andersle/chemometrics.git
    ```

## Exercises

Here is a brief overview of the exercises:

* **exercise-000**: Two Jupyter notebooks to help you familiarize yourself with Jupyter and brush up on your Python skills.
* **exercise-001**: Least squares regression for linear and non-linear models.
* **exercise-002**: Least squares regression with multiple variables and experimental design.
* **exercise-003**: Experimental design (full and fractional).
* **exercise-004**: Principal component analysis and clustering.
* **exercise-005**: Partial least squares regression and making use of training and testing sets.
* **exercise-006**: Classification.
